# DETR: DEtection TRansformer

DETR (DEtection TRansformer) is a deep learning model for object detection and segmentation. It combines transformers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect objects in images efficiently and accurately.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Object Detection**: No need for hand-crafted components like anchors or region proposals.
- **Fast and Accurate**: Works well on common object detection tasks.
- **Simple Architecture**: Combines a CNN for feature extraction with a transformer for object detection.

## How It Works

1. **Input Image**: The model takes an image as input.
2. **Feature Extraction**: A CNN extracts features from the image.
3. **Transformer**: These features are processed by a transformer to detect objects and predict their bounding boxes.
4. **Output**: The model outputs the detected objects and their locations.

## Applications

- Autonomous driving
- Surveillance systems
- Medical image analysis
- General-purpose object detection
